=====

The files in this directory are auto-generated through `gulp build`. If you alter them by hand, expect them to be overwritten the next time you run the task!

Contents
--------

Several files are produced in the build. You'll probably just want to use __r7insight.min.js__, however.

* __r7insight.js__: JS client library, unminified
* __r7insight.min.js__: JS client library, minified
